        <li>Stir ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar together in a bowl until brown sugar is dissolved; spread over turkey loaf.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the loaf should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
